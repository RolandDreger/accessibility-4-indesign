# Privacy Policy

1. Introduction

This privacy policy informs you about the type, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data in connection with the use of the Adobe InDesign plugin “Accessibility-4-InDesign”.

2. Persons responsible

Roland Dreger, Tempelgasse 5, 1020 Vienna, Austria, email: roland.dreger@ik.me is responsible for data processing within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Please direct all data protection inquiries to this contact address.

3. Personal data collection

The plugin does not collect any personal user data. Only the number of operations (requests via AI assistants, PDF generation) and the date of the last access are recorded for license verification purposes.

All entries you make in the AI assistant are transmitted via the OpenAI API for the creation of a response. This data may contain personal information if you include it in your requests. No InDesign document content or other personal data is stored or passed on to third parties.

4. Purpose and legal basis of the processing
 
The sole purpose of recording the number of accesses and the last access date is to check and manage the license for the plugin. The processing of your requests in the AI Assistant is based on your voluntary consent, which you give by asking questions and submitting them. PDF documents are created via the Adobe Document Services API. Only the content of the report shown in the plugin and no other data is transmitted to Adobe.

5. Transfer to third parties and order processing

The plugin uses the [Adobe Document Services API](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/) for PDF generation. Adobe processes the data for the creation of the PDF files on our behalf. Your data will not be disclosed or passed on beyond this.

For AI assistance, your requests are transmitted to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) via the OpenAI API. OpenAI processes this data on our behalf. Your data will not be disclosed or passed on beyond this.

The feature “Share report” is accessed via the Internet address https://document.report. This website is operated by the plugin creator and is located on a server operated by the company [Infomaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com/de) in Switzerland. The data will not be passed on to third parties. The plugin manufacturer may access the shared data for service requests. You can delete your own data from the transmitted reports at any time after logging in at [document.report](https://document.report/panel) or request that all data be deleted. Access to the data is password-protected.

6. Data security

Technical and organizational measures are taken to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss or manipulation. The transmission of requests to OpenAI and the data for PDF creation to Adobe is encrypted via a secure API connection.

7. Storage period

The stored license verification data (number of accesses and last access date) is stored for the entire service life of the plugin and deleted after the license period has expired.

8. Your rights

You have the right to information about the data stored by us and to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing. You can also object to data processing at any time and request data portability, insofar as this is technically possible.

9 Amendments to this privacy policy

This privacy policy may be amended if necessary, for example if the plug-in functionality is expanded or legal requirements change. The current version can be viewed at any time on the [Accessibility-4-InDesign website](https://github.com/RolandDreger/accessibility-4-indesign).

10. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about data protection, you can contact the data protection officer at any time (see contact above).
