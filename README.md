# Accessibility-4-InDesign
Adobe InDesign plugin that assists users in creating accessible documents.

Accessibility-4-InDesign currently includes two (independent) plugins: a report panel (with integrated question area) and an alt-text panel. A plugin for contrast checking is currently being planned. The panels are intended to provide simple assistance in identifying and solving accessibility-related problems. 

However, some special problems that cannot be solved with InDesigns built-in tools must still be handled in Acrobat or using specialized extensions - such as tagging complex tables.

## Report

The report lists missing entries and possible problems during the creation of an InDesign document. As a kind of checklist, the report helps to keep an eye on the most important accessibility requirements before the PDF or ePub export. The result can be exported as a PDF file.
